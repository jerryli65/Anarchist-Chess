# Anarchist-Chess
A chess variant containing fun doodads representing the AnarchyChess online community.

# Introduction
Affectionately known as "Garry Chess", Anarchist Chess is functionally a regular game of chess except for one thing: it contains specific, and seemingly random, kinks that occasionally change the fundamental gameplay. These kinks are the result of the most popular jokes that people like to make about chess, and they are inspired by the subreddit r/AnarchyChess. Such jokes include a silly piece set (of which each piece's design has a very particular meaning), a fascination with the en passant rule, and a continuous debate on the exact movement path of a "horsey", or knight.

This program aims to recognize each of these jokes all in one compiled chess variant. Unlike "real" chess, this program continually gets updates.

The game is written in Python with the Tkinter framework.

## Playing "Garry Chess"
To play this game, download the code file Chess.py. Then, run **python3 Chess.py** in your terminal. To exit, simply click the X button on the Tk popup.
